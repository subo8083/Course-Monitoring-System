# Course Monitoring System

In this project I have designed a course monitoring system using MySQL and JDBC driver along with java, here 4 tables is added i.e Batch, Faculty, Course, Course-Plan and with the help of these tables several operations is perfomed using Scanner class(By taking input from user) i.e, DYNAMICALLY. 



The Admin has following responsiblities and rights to perform operations like:
#
1) Login using username and password
2) Create, Update and View Faculty
3) Ceate, Update and View Course
4) Create, Update and View Course-Plan
5) Create, Update and View Batch
6) Allocate Faculty to a particular batch.

Similary we have Faculty panel whose right is to:
#
1) Login using username and password
2) View Courses available
3) View faculty allocated for a particular batch
4) Daywise plan for faculties
5) Search faculty by using his/her username
6) Update password

The Tech-Stack:
