In this project I have designed a course monitoring table using MySQL and JDBC driver along with java, here i have added 4 tables i.e Batch, Faculty, Course, Course-Plan
in which we have an Admin whose work is assigned as:
#
1) Login using username and password
2) Create, Update and View Faculty
3) Ceate, Update and View Course
4) Create, Update and View Course-Plan
5) Create, Update and View Batch
6) Allocate Faculty to a particular batch
